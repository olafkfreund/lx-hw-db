## 2025-08-26: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Community

### Decision

Establish lx-hw-db as a privacy-first, community-driven Linux hardware compatibility database leveraging GitHub's infrastructure for transparent governance, Git-based storage for scalability, and comprehensive privacy protection through cryptographic anonymization.

### Context

Linux hardware compatibility remains a significant barrier to adoption, with users facing uncertainty about hardware purchases, complex configuration requirements, and privacy concerns with existing hardware reporting tools. The community needs a comprehensive, privacy-preserving solution that leverages proven open-source collaboration patterns.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Database Approach**
   - Pros: Faster queries, complex relationships, centralized control
   - Cons: Infrastructure costs, single point of failure, opaque governance, scaling challenges

2. **Wiki-Based System**
   - Pros: Easy editing, community contributions, low technical barrier
   - Cons: Version control limitations, quality control challenges, limited automation, search limitations

3. **Proprietary Hardware Database**
   - Pros: Professional quality control, vendor partnerships, marketing reach
   - Cons: Closed source, privacy concerns, vendor lock-in, limited community input

### Rationale

The GitHub-based approach provides several key advantages:

1. **Proven Collaboration Model**: GitHub's pull request workflow provides transparent governance, quality control through peer review, and natural conflict resolution mechanisms
2. **Built-in Infrastructure**: Git provides distributed storage, version control, backup, and rollback capabilities without additional database infrastructure
3. **Privacy-First Architecture**: Cryptographic anonymization and differential privacy can be implemented at the data collection stage, protecting user privacy while maintaining utility
4. **Community Ownership**: Open-source model ensures long-term community control and prevents vendor lock-in
5. **Cost Effectiveness**: Leverages free GitHub infrastructure for hosting, CI/CD, and collaboration tools
6. **Scalability**: Git's distributed architecture naturally scales to millions of entries across global contributors

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete transparency in governance and data handling
- Natural version control and audit trail for all changes
- Distributed redundancy eliminates single points of failure
- Strong privacy protection builds user trust and adoption
- Community ownership ensures long-term sustainability
- Proven collaboration patterns from successful open-source projects

**Negative:**
- Complex queries require additional tooling beyond Git
- Initial development complexity for privacy implementation
- Community adoption requires education and onboarding
- Quality control depends on community engagement and processes

## 2025-08-26: Privacy-First Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Privacy Officer, Community

### Decision

Implement comprehensive privacy protection through HMAC-SHA256 with time-rotating salts, differential privacy with Laplace noise (epsilon=1.0), and k-anonymity principles to ensure user anonymity while maintaining statistical utility for hardware compatibility analysis.

### Context

Hardware detection inherently involves collecting system information that could potentially identify users or expose sensitive configurations. GDPR compliance and user trust require strong privacy guarantees from the data collection stage through storage and analysis.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **No Privacy Protection**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, more detailed data
   - Cons: Privacy violations, GDPR non-compliance, user distrust

2. **Basic Anonymization Only**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, basic privacy protection
   - Cons: Vulnerable to re-identification attacks, insufficient for GDPR

3. **Complete Data Encryption**
   - Pros: Maximum security
   - Cons: No statistical utility, cannot perform compatibility analysis

### Rationale

Multi-layered privacy approach provides:
- **Cryptographic Protection**: HMAC-SHA256 prevents raw identifier exposure
- **Time-Based Security**: Rotating salts prevent cross-temporal correlation
- **Statistical Privacy**: Differential privacy adds calibrated noise while preserving trends
- **Anonymity Guarantees**: K-anonymity ensures individual configurations cannot be isolated
- **User Control**: Multiple privacy levels allow user preference selection

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- GDPR compliance and legal protection
- User trust and community adoption
- Statistical utility preservation for compatibility analysis
- Protection against re-identification attacks
- Competitive advantage in privacy-conscious market

**Negative:**
- Implementation complexity and development time
- Some statistical precision loss due to noise injection
- Need for ongoing privacy auditing and validation

## 2025-08-26: Federated Architecture Design

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Enterprise Customers, Community

### Decision

Implement federated architecture enabling organizations to maintain private hardware databases while contributing anonymized data to the public repository through Git's distributed synchronization with configurable trust weighting and automated conflict resolution.

### Context

Organizations need to balance internal hardware inventory management with community contribution. Private configurations may contain sensitive information while public contribution improves overall compatibility knowledge. A federated approach enables both use cases.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Centralized Only**
   - Pros: Simpler architecture, single source of truth
   - Cons: No private deployment option, limits organizational adoption

2. **Completely Separate Systems**
   - Pros: Clear separation of concerns
   - Cons: No knowledge sharing, duplicated effort, limited data coverage

3. **API-Based Federation**
   - Pros: Real-time synchronization, complex queries
   - Cons: Infrastructure complexity, single points of failure, privacy concerns

### Rationale

Git-based federation provides:
- **Natural Distribution**: Git's designed for distributed collaboration
- **Flexible Privacy**: Organizations control what data is shared publicly
- **Trust Management**: Configurable weighting based on source reliability
- **Conflict Resolution**: Established Git merge strategies with manual review options
- **Version Control**: Full audit trail of all synchronization activities

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Enterprise adoption without compromising privacy
- Broader hardware coverage through organizational participation
- Proven synchronization technology with Git
- Configurable trust and validation policies

**Negative:**
- Architecture complexity for synchronization logic
- Need for clear governance across federated nodes
- Potential data consistency challenges across repositories

## 2025-08-26: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt multi-language architecture with Rust for hardware detection (performance and safety), Go for data processing (concurrency and deployment), Python/FastAPI for web API (rapid development), and TypeScript/React for frontend (modern user experience).

### Context

Different components have varying requirements for performance, safety, development speed, and ecosystem support. A multi-language approach optimizes each component for its specific needs while maintaining reasonable complexity.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Language (Python)**
   - Pros: Unified codebase, faster initial development
   - Cons: Performance limitations for hardware detection, deployment complexity

2. **Single Language (Rust)**
   - Pros: Maximum performance and safety throughout
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve, slower web development

3. **JavaScript/Node.js Stack**
   - Pros: Unified language, rapid development, large ecosystem
   - Cons: Performance limitations, memory usage, system programming challenges

### Rationale

Multi-language approach provides:
- **Rust CLI**: Single binary distribution, memory safety, maximum performance for hardware detection
- **Go Processing**: Excellent concurrency, simple deployment, fast compilation for data processing pipelines
- **Python API**: Rich ecosystem, rapid development, excellent library support for web services
- **TypeScript Frontend**: Type safety, modern tooling, excellent React ecosystem

### Consequences

**Positive:**
