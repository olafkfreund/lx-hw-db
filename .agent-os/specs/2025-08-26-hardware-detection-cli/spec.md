# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Hardware Detection CLI Tool
> Created: 2025-08-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create a Rust-based CLI tool that comprehensively detects hardware information using multiple system utilities (lshw, dmidecode, lspci, lsusb, inxi) while implementing privacy-preserving anonymization to enable secure community contribution to the hardware compatibility database.

## User Stories

### Hardware Detection and Report Generation
As a **Linux user**, I want to run a single command that detects all my hardware components, so that I can understand my system configuration and contribute anonymized data to the community database.

### Privacy-Preserving Data Collection  
As a **privacy-conscious user**, I want my hardware identifiers to be anonymized using cryptographic techniques, so that I can contribute compatibility data without compromising my personal information or system security.

### Community Database Contribution
As a **community member**, I want to generate standardized hardware reports in markdown format with YAML frontmatter, so that my data can be easily integrated into the GitHub-based hardware database for others to benefit from.

### Multi-Tool Hardware Profiling
As a **system administrator**, I want comprehensive hardware detection that combines multiple tools (lshw, dmidecode, lspci, lsusb, inxi), so that I get the most complete and accurate hardware inventory possible.

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-Tool Hardware Detection** - Integrate lshw, dmidecode, lspci, lsusb, and inxi to create comprehensive hardware profiles with error handling for missing tools
2. **Privacy-Preserving Anonymization** - Implement SHA-512 hashing with HMAC-SHA256 and time-rotating salts for hardware identifiers while preserving statistical utility
3. **Structured Output Generation** - Generate standardized markdown reports with YAML frontmatter compatible with the hardware database schema
4. **CLI Interface Design** - Create user-friendly command-line interface with configurable privacy levels (Basic/Enhanced/Strict) and output formats
5. **Error Handling and Validation** - Robust error handling for missing system tools, insufficient permissions, and malformed hardware data
6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Support major Linux distributions with different package managers and system configurations

## Out of Scope

- Web interface or GUI components (Phase 3 feature)
- Automatic GitHub submission workflow (Phase 2 feature)  
- Configuration recommendation engine (Phase 4 feature)
- Differential privacy noise injection (Phase 1 should-have, can be added later)
- Database storage or search functionality (Phase 3 feature)
- Federation or multi-repository synchronization (Phase 5 feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional CLI Binary** - Single Rust binary that can be distributed and executed on major Linux distributions without additional dependencies
2. **Comprehensive Hardware Detection** - Tool successfully detects and reports CPU, GPU, motherboard, memory, storage, network, USB, and PCI devices using multiple detection methods
3. **Privacy-Compliant Output** - Generated reports contain anonymized hardware identifiers while maintaining enough detail for compatibility analysis
4. **Schema-Compliant Markdown** - Output format matches the defined YAML frontmatter + markdown structure for seamless database integration
5. **Robust Error Handling** - Tool gracefully handles missing utilities, permission errors, and edge cases with helpful error messages
6. **Documentation and Examples** - Complete usage documentation with example outputs for different privacy levels and hardware configurations
