# Linux hardware probe system design

## Executive Overview

This comprehensive design document outlines a community-driven Linux hardware compatibility database system that leverages GitHub's infrastructure for markdown-based storage, implements privacy-preserving data collection, and provides actionable configuration recommendations. The system combines proven open-source patterns with modern automation to create a scalable, federated architecture capable of handling millions of hardware entries while maintaining complete user anonymity.

## Hardware detection architecture  

The core hardware detection tool combines multiple proven Linux utilities to create comprehensive hardware profiles while maintaining privacy. Based on the successful hw-probe model, the system employs a multi-tool approach using **lshw** for comprehensive hardware information in JSON format, **dmidecode** for BIOS and motherboard details, **lspci -k** for PCI devices with kernel driver mapping, **lsusb** for USB peripherals, and **inxi** for user-friendly system summaries.

The detection script implements privacy protection at the collection stage. All serial numbers, MAC addresses, and UUIDs undergo SHA-512 hashing with daily-rotating salts, retaining only 32-byte prefixes to prevent tracking across submissions. The system automatically removes usernames, hostnames, and IP addresses from all collected data. Hardware models are generalized into categories (Intel Core iX Series, NVIDIA RTX Series) to prevent unique identification while maintaining utility for compatibility matching.

For driver detection, the tool reads `/sys/bus/pci/devices/*/driver` symlinks to identify active drivers, parses `/proc/modules` for loaded kernel modules, and queries DKMS status for dynamic modules. This comprehensive approach ensures accurate driver-hardware associations without exposing sensitive system information.

## GitHub-based markdown database structure

The repository follows a hierarchical organization optimized for both human navigation and automated processing. Hardware entries are organized by category (cpu, gpu, motherboard, network, peripherals), then by manufacturer subdirectories. Each hardware entry uses a standardized markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing structured metadata.

```yaml
---
name: "Intel Core i7-12700K"
category: "cpu"
manufacturer: "Intel"
compatibility_status: "full"
last_tested: "2024-08-15"
specs:
  socket: "LGA1700"
  cores: 12
  threads: 20
compatibility:
  linux:
    kernel_version: "5.15+"
    status: "full"
    notes: "All features supported including P-cores and E-cores"
tested_configurations:
  - motherboard: "ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E"
    memory: "DDR5-5600"
    status: "working"
---
```

This structure enables powerful searching through static site generators while maintaining human readability. The system generates multiple index files (categories.json, manufacturers.json, compatibility-matrix.json) that enable client-side searching without requiring a traditional database backend.

## Automated processing via GitHub Actions

The submission workflow employs sophisticated GitHub Actions for validation and processing. When users submit hardware data through pull requests, automated workflows validate markdown syntax using markdownlint, verify required frontmatter fields, check for duplicate entries using fuzzy matching algorithms, and run hardware ID validation scripts. 

Upon successful validation, the system automatically generates search indexes using tools like mddb, updates category and manufacturer indexes, builds static search interfaces using Hugo or Jekyll, and deploys to GitHub Pages for web access. The workflow includes automatic approval mechanisms for trusted contributors and uses the GitHub API for programmatic PR management.

Duplicate detection employs multi-stage fuzzy matching combining exact hardware ID comparison, Levenshtein distance on device names, specification similarity scoring, and weighted confidence calculations. Entries scoring above 85% similarity trigger manual review to prevent duplicate data while allowing for hardware variations and revisions.

## Privacy and anonymization implementation

The privacy architecture implements multiple layers of protection following GDPR compliance standards. Hardware identifiers undergo cryptographic transformations using HMAC-SHA256 with time-rotating salts that change daily. The system implements differential privacy by adding calibrated Laplace noise to numeric values (epsilon=1.0) while preserving statistical utility.

Hardware profiles are generalized using k-anonymity principles, ensuring each configuration appears at least k times in the dataset. Device capabilities are reported as ranges rather than exact values (4-8GB RAM, 4-8 CPU cores), and driver versions are generalized to major release families. The system never collects or stores personal files, browser history, network configurations beyond basic interface types, or any form of user credentials.

For enhanced privacy, users can select from three privacy levels. Basic mode performs standard anonymization, Enhanced mode adds additional generalization and noise, while Strict mode maximizes privacy through aggressive generalization and minimal data collection.

## Configuration assistance and driver recommendations

The recommendation engine employs a multi-stage approach to suggest optimal configurations. First, it performs exact hardware ID matching against the database, then analyzes similar devices using collaborative filtering techniques. Success rates are calculated based on community-reported configurations, kernel version compatibility matrices, and distribution-specific package availability.

The system generates personalized configuration files including kernel parameters optimized for detected hardware, Xorg.conf sections for graphics configuration, modprobe.d rules for driver loading, and GRUB parameters for boot optimization. All recommendations are capability-based rather than model-specific, ensuring privacy while providing accurate guidance.

Driver recommendations utilize DKMS integration for automatic module rebuilding across kernel updates. The system maintains mappings between hardware IDs and driver packages across major distributions (apt, dnf, pacman, zypper), providing installation commands tailored to the user's system.

## Community contribution workflows

The contribution model follows proven open-source patterns with graduated trust levels. New contributors submit hardware profiles through guided templates, experienced contributors gain direct commit access to specific hardware categories, and core maintainers oversee architecture and policy decisions. 

Quality control employs automated validation for schema compliance and data consistency, peer review requiring two community approvals, expert validation from component-specific maintainers, and final approval from core maintainers. The system includes gamification elements such as contributor badges, category-specific leaderboards, and annual recognition for top contributors.

Conflict resolution follows a structured process where conflicting reports trigger community discussion, weighted voting based on contributor reputation determines outcomes, and detailed documentation captures resolution rationale for future reference.

## Federated architecture design

The system's federated design enables distributed collaboration while maintaining data quality. The primary repository serves as the authoritative source, while specialized repositories focus on specific hardware categories or use cases. Community repositories provide additional coverage with appropriate trust weighting.

Synchronization occurs through Git's native distributed architecture with hourly pulls from trusted sources, automated validation of incoming data, and timestamp-based conflict resolution with manual review options. Trust levels determine data precedence with authoritative sources taking priority over community submissions.

The federation configuration uses YAML manifests defining node relationships, synchronization policies, validation requirements, and trust hierarchies. This enables organizations to maintain private hardware databases while contributing anonymized data to the public repository.

## Search and discovery implementation

Search functionality combines multiple approaches for comprehensive coverage. Static site generators (Hugo, Jekyll) provide basic browsing interfaces, FlexSearch enables client-side full-text searching, Algolia integration offers advanced cloud-based search for larger deployments, and GitHub's search API provides programmatic access.

The search index includes tokenized hardware names and models, categorized compatibility statuses, driver recommendation confidence scores, and community testing metrics. Users can search by natural language queries, specific hardware IDs, compatibility requirements, or configuration parameters.

## Technical implementation stack

The recommended technology stack balances performance, maintainability, and community accessibility. The hardware probe tool uses **Rust** for maximum performance and safety, providing a single binary without dependencies. Data processing employs **Go** for concurrent processing and simple deployment. The Web API uses **Python** with FastAPI for rapid development and rich ecosystem integration. The search interface leverages **TypeScript** with React for modern, responsive user experiences.

For deployment, the system uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation, GitHub Pages for static site hosting, optional PostgreSQL for advanced querying capabilities, Redis for caching frequently accessed data, and CDN integration for global content delivery.

## Scalability and performance optimization

The architecture supports horizontal scaling through database sharding by hardware category, CDN caching of static content and API responses, microservice separation of concerns, and load-balanced API endpoints. Performance optimizations include multi-level caching strategies, lazy loading of detailed hardware information, progressive enhancement of search capabilities, and efficient diff algorithms for federation synchronization.

The system can handle millions of hardware entries through intelligent indexing, thousands of concurrent users via CDN and caching, and hundreds of daily contributions through automated validation. The Git-based storage provides natural version control, rollback capabilities, and distributed redundancy.

## Conclusion and implementation roadmap

This design provides a comprehensive, privacy-preserving, community-driven hardware compatibility database that leverages proven open-source patterns and modern automation. The system's strength lies in combining established tools like lshw and dmidecode with innovative approaches to privacy protection and community collaboration.

The implementation should proceed in phases, starting with core infrastructure and basic CLI tools, followed by community features and web interfaces, and culminating in advanced features like federated synchronization and ML-based recommendations. This approach ensures a solid foundation while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and community-driven evolution.

The GitHub-based approach eliminates traditional database infrastructure costs while providing natural version control, transparent governance through pull requests, and infinite scalability through Git's distributed architecture. Combined with strong privacy guarantees and comprehensive driver recommendations, this system can become the definitive resource for Linux hardware compatibility.
