.SH NAME
lx-hw-detect-qt6 \- Qt6 QML GUI for Linux Hardware Database detection tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lx-hw-detect-qt6
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lx-hw-detect-qt6
provides a cross-platform graphical user interface for the Linux Hardware Database hardware detection tool using Qt6 QML and Material Design 3 theming. 
.PP
\fBNote:\fR Currently runs in demonstration mode due to cxx-qt compatibility issues with Qt6 6.9+. The complete interface design and functionality are implemented and ready for full cxx-qt integration when compatibility is resolved.
.PP
The application features a modern Material Design 3 interface with privacy-focused theming and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

.SH INTERFACE
The Qt6 QML GUI provides six main screens with Material Design 3 theming:
.TP
.B Welcome Screen
Privacy overview with Material Design cards, data collection explanation, and workflow visualization
.TP
.B Detection Screen
Real-time hardware detection progress with Material Design progress indicators and tool-specific status
.TP
.B Hardware Screen
Expandable hardware categories with device compatibility status, filtering, and detailed device information
.TP
.B Configuration Screen
System compatibility scoring, driver recommendations with installation previews, and kernel parameter suggestions
.TP
.B Submission Screen
GitHub-integrated community submission with step-by-step workflow, privacy indicators, and submission history
.TP
.B Privacy Screen
Interactive privacy level selection with live data previews, GDPR compliance features, and detailed anonymization explanations
.SH PRIVACY LEVELS
.TP
.B Basic
Device models only, no personal identifiers collected. Suitable for basic compatibility checking.
.TP
.B Enhanced (Recommended)
HMAC-SHA256 hashing with time-rotating salts, k-anonymity protection. Balances privacy with data utility.
.TP
.B Strict
Differential privacy with statistical noise injection (ε=1.0) for maximum anonymization. May reduce data precision.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Successful execution
.TP
.B 1
General error (missing dependencies, Qt6 issues)
.TP
.B 2
Configuration error
.TP
.B 3
QML loading error
.SH DEPENDENCIES
.B lx-hw-detect-qt6
requires Qt6 6.5+ with QML modules. For full functionality (when available), cxx-qt integration requires Qt6 development libraries and compatible cxx-qt version.
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.IP \[bu] 2
Currently runs in demonstration mode due to cxx-qt compatibility with Qt6 6.9+
.IP \[bu] 2
Full backend integration pending cxx-qt updates for newer Qt6 versions
.IP \[bu] 2
Some Qt6 deprecated API warnings during build (does not affect functionality)
