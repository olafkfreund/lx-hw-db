## Advanced Submission Workflows

### Bulk Hardware Submissions

For organizations with many systems to submit:

**Preparation**
```bash
# Generate reports for multiple systems
for system in system1 system2 system3; do
    ssh $system "./lx-hw-detect detect --privacy enhanced --output ${system}-report.json"
    scp $system:${system}-report.json ./reports/
done

# Batch validation
find ./reports -name "*.json" -exec ./lx-hw-detect validate {} \;
```

**Submission Process**
1. Contact maintainers before bulk submission
2. Use dedicated branch for organization submissions
3. Include detailed organization and use-case information
4. Coordinate with expert reviewers for efficient review

### Hardware Vendor Partnerships

**Vendor Submission Process**
1. Initial contact with core team
2. Legal and licensing review
3. Technical integration planning
4. Pilot testing with limited hardware set
5. Full integration with vendor-specific validation

**Requirements for Vendor Submissions**
- Compliance with privacy and anonymization standards
- Clear licensing of submitted compatibility data
- Technical contact for ongoing support
- Commitment to update data for new hardware releases

### Distribution Integration

**Distribution Maintainer Workflow**
```bash
# Clone distribution-specific branch
git clone -b distribution-nixos https://github.com/your-org/lx-hw-db.git

# Generate reports using distribution-specific configurations
./lx-hw-detect detect \
    --distribution nixos \
    --privacy enhanced \
    --include-kernel-config \
    --output distro-report.json

# Submit with distribution-specific metadata
git add distro-report.json
git commit -m "Add NixOS 25.11 hardware compatibility report"
git push origin distribution-nixos
```

## Quality Assurance

### Hardware Report Quality Standards

**Tier 1: Excellent Quality**
- Complete hardware detection (all major components)

**Tier 2: Good Quality**
- Most hardware detected with minor gaps
- Recent kernel version (within 12 months)
- Basic compatibility information provided
- Single community verification
- Useful for general compatibility reference

**Tier 3: Acceptable Quality**
- Basic hardware detection with significant gaps
- Older kernel versions with justification
- Limited compatibility information
- Unverified but passes automated validation
- Historical value or rare hardware configurations

### Community Verification Process

**Verification Levels**

**Self-Verified**: Reporter confirms accuracy of their own submission
**Community-Verified**: Other users confirm similar hardware behavior
